#### [Checkout Bootstrap Here](http://getbootstrap.com)

##[Live Example Here](http://daynnight.paperplane.io)

###Quickstart:

If you want to simply use the library, all you need to do is clone the repo and grab just the night.min.css and dayNnight.js files, then link into your web pages.

  - `<link href="../../dist/css/night.min.css" rel="stylesheet">`
  - `<script src="dayNnight.js"></script>`

###Testing:

If you want to make global changes / test / generate different color schemes for possible themes, download the entire repo and follow the setup instructions from bootstrap [here](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/).

##Philosophy:
 - Why should a button be blue 24/7? 
 - Web should be a ever more growing reflection of real life
 - Lightbulb alert, changing UI’s based on data captured from client
 - Weird Zone:
 - psych article of color psychology, showing inclinations towards different colors among genders. Postulations on how to change ui in a better way for the user, every time, always. {Aim is to NOT make a ‘girly’ or ‘boyish’ internet.} Always be dedicated to a better experience for the user.
