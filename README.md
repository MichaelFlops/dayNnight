##Philosophy:
 - Why should a button be blue 24/7? 
 - Web should be a ever more growing reflection of real life
 - Lightbulb alert, changing UI’s based on data captured from client
 - Weird Zone:
 - psych article of color psychology, showing inclinations towards different colors among genders. Postulations on how to change ui in a better way for the user, every time, always. {Aim is to NOT make a ‘girly’ or ‘boyish’ internet.} Always be dedicated to a better experience for the user.
